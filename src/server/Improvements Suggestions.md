Things that can be improved:
1.  Error handling: The script does not handle errors very well. If the default_menu file is not found, for example, 
    the script will simply print an error message and exit. It would be better to add proper error handling to handle 
    these cases in a more elegant way.
    -   Wrap the entire start_server function in a try-except block to catch any unexpected errors and handle them gracefully.
    -   Add try-except blocks around the bind and accept methods to handle any errors that occur while binding to a port or accepting incoming connections.
    -   Add try-except blocks around the open method when opening the default_menu and dest_file files to handle any errors that occur while opening the files.

2.  Logging: The script only prints out messages to the console, but it would be more useful if it also logged those messages to a file. 
    This would allow for easier debugging and tracking of issues.
    -   Import the logging module
    -   Create a logger and set the logging level
    -   Add log messages throughout the script to log important events, such as when a client connects or when a file is saved.

3.  Security: The script does not have any security features. It would be good to add encryption for the data sent between the client and the server. 
    Also, it could be useful to add some sort of authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.
    -   Use encryption for the data sent between the client and the server. (AES)
    -   Add some sort of authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access. (RSA)

4.  File handling: The script uses a temp file to satisfy the syntax rule, but it would be better to remove it 
    and handle the file-related functionality directly.
    -   Remove the temp file and handle the file-related functionality directly.
    -   Add some validation to check the file types of the default_menu file and the dest_file file.

5.  Scalability: The script is quite simple and doesn't handle a large number of clients very well. 
    It might be useful to implement a more robust and scalable solution if the server is expected to handle a large number of clients.
    -   Use a thread pool to handle incoming connections, instead of creating a new thread for each connection.
    -   Use a database to store the end-of-day orders, instead of saving them to a file.
    -   Implement load balancing to distribute the workload among multiple servers.

Note: AES for the data encryption, and RSA (Digital Signatures) for the key exchange and authentication.
============================================================================================

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that can be used to encrypt data sent between the client and the server.

1.  Import the pycryptodome library. This library provides a python implementation of AES and other cryptographic algorithms.

2.  Generate an AES key and a initialization vector (IV). The key should be a byte string of length 16, 24, or 32 bytes, and the IV should be a byte string of length 16 bytes. These values can be generated using the Random.getrandbits() method in the random library.

3.  Encrypt the data before sending it to the client. To encrypt the data, you would use the AES.new() method and pass in the key, the IV, and the mode of operation (e.g. AES.MODE_CBC). You would then use the encrypt() method to encrypt the data, and the hex() method to convert the encrypted data to a hexadecimal string.

4.  Decrypt the data after receiving it from the client. To decrypt the data, you would use the AES.new() method and pass in the key, the IV, and the mode of operation. You would then use the decrypt() method to decrypt the data, and the bytes.fromhex() method to convert the hexadecimal string back to bytes.

You would need to encrypt the data before sending it to the client, and decrypt it after receiving it from the client.

============================================================================================

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that can be used to implement an authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access in this script.

1.  Import the rsa library. This library provides an implementation of RSA encryption and decryption in Python.

2.  Generate an RSA key pair on the server. This will consist of a private key and a public key. The private key should be kept secure on the server, and the public key should be shared with the client.

3.  On the client side, encrypt a message using the server's public key. This message will typically include a username and a password, or other identifying information.

4.  On the server side, decrypt the message using the private key. This will reveal the original message and allow the server to verify the identity of the client.

5.  Once the client is authenticated, the server could generate a session key, encrypt it using the client's public key and send it to the client.

6.  On the client side, the session key is decrypted using the client's private key.

7.  The client and the server can use the session key to encrypt/decrypt messages sent between them during the session.

8.  When the session is over, the session key should be discarded.
