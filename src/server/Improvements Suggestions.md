Things that can be improved:
1.  Error handling: The script does not handle errors very well. If the default_menu file is not found, for example, 
    the script will simply print an error message and exit. It would be better to add proper error handling to handle 
    these cases in a more elegant way.
    -   Wrap the entire start_server function in a try-except block to catch any unexpected errors and handle them gracefully.
    -   Add try-except blocks around the bind and accept methods to handle any errors that occur while binding to a port or accepting incoming connections.
    -   Add try-except blocks around the open method when opening the default_menu and dest_file files to handle any errors that occur while opening the files.

2.  Logging: The script only prints out messages to the console, but it would be more useful if it also logged those messages to a file. 
    This would allow for easier debugging and tracking of issues.
    -   Import the logging module
    -   Create a logger and set the logging level
    -   Add log messages throughout the script to log important events, such as when a client connects or when a file is saved.

3.  Security: The script does not have any security features. It would be good to add encryption for the data sent between the client and the server. 
    Also, it could be useful to add some sort of authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.
    -   Use encryption for the data sent between the client and the server.
    -   Add some sort of authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.

4.  File handling: The script uses a temp file to satisfy the syntax rule, but it would be better to remove it 
    and handle the file-related functionality directly.
    -   Remove the temp file and handle the file-related functionality directly.
    -   Add some validation to check the file types of the default_menu file and the dest_file file.

5.  Scalability: The script is quite simple and doesn't handle a large number of clients very well. 
    It might be useful to implement a more robust and scalable solution if the server is expected to handle a large number of clients.
    -   Use a thread pool to handle incoming connections, instead of creating a new thread for each connection.
    -   Use a database to store the end-of-day orders, instead of saving them to a file.
    -   Implement load balancing to distribute the workload among multiple servers.
