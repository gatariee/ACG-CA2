This script is a Python implementation of a client for a simple TCP server. The client and server use RSA encryption for secure communication. The client sends commands to the server, such as requesting the menu or sending a "day end" report. The client also exchanges public keys and certificates with the server for authentication. The client also signs the data with its private key before sending it to the server and verifies the signature of the data received from the server using the server's public key.

Client Functions:
1. `exchange_certs()`: This function connects to the server, sends the command to exchange certificates, and receives the server's certificate. It then opens the client's certificate and sends it to the server.
2. `check_certs(cert)`: This function takes in a certificate as an argument, opens the correct server certificate, and verifies it against the received certificate. If the verification is successful, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
3. `exchange_keys()`: This function connects to the server, sends the command to exchange keys, opens the client's public key and sends it to the server. It then receives the server's public key and creates a PKCS1_OAEP cipher object with it.
4. `send_file()`: This function connects to the server, sends the command to close the day, opens the "day_end.csv" file, signs the data with the client's private key and sends the signature and data to the server.
5. `receive_file()`: This function connects to the server, sends the command to receive the menu, receives the menu file along with the server's signature, verifies the signature using the server's public key, and returns the data if the signature is valid.
6. `initialize_keys()`: It takes a password, and then it tries to open the private key file, and if it can't, it prints an error message and exits. If it can, it tries to open the public key file, and if it can't, it prints an error message and exits. If it can, it returns the private and public keys.
